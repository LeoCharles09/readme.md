Recognition of Software Engineering (1968): The NATO conference formalized software engineering as a discipline, emphasizing systematic development approaches.
Agile Methodologies (2001): The Agile Manifesto promoted iterative development and flexibility, transforming software development practices.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: Define the project scope, objectives, and feasibility. This phase involves gathering requirements and creating a project plan.
Requirements Analysis: Gather detailed requirements from stakeholders to understand what the software needs to achieve. This phase results in a requirements specification document.
Design: Create the architecture and design of the software. This includes defining system components, interfaces, and data flow.
Implementation (Coding): Write the actual code based on the design documents. This phase involves converting design specifications into functional software.
Testing: Verify that the software works as intended. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.
Deployment: Release the software to users. This phase involves installing the software in the production environment and ensuring it is operational.
Maintenance: Perform ongoing maintenance to fix bugs, update features, and ensure the software continues to meet user needs.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology
Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach to software development. Each phase must be completed before the next one begins, and there is little room for changes once a phase is finished.

Key Characteristics:

Structured Phases: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance.
Documentation: Extensive documentation at each stage.
Predictability: Clear milestones and timelines.
Change Management: Changes are difficult and costly to implement once the project is underway.
When to Use:

Clear Requirements: Projects with well-defined and unchanging requirements.
Regulated Industries: Projects that must comply with strict regulations and standards (e.g., healthcare, aerospace).
Large-Scale Projects: Projects where a detailed plan and predictable outcomes are essential.
Example: Developing software for a medical device where regulatory compliance and thorough documentation are critical.

Agile Methodology
Agile is an iterative and flexible approach to software development. It focuses on collaboration, customer feedback, and small, incremental releases.

Key Characteristics:

Iterative Development: Work is divided into small, manageable units called sprints.
Flexibility: Easily accommodates changes and new requirements.
Collaboration: Emphasizes teamwork and customer involvement.
Continuous Improvement: Regularly reviews and improves processes and products.
When to Use:

Evolving Requirements: Projects where requirements are expected to change or are not fully known at the start.
Fast-Paced Environments: Projects that need quick delivery and frequent updates (e.g., startups, tech companies).
Customer-Centric Projects: Projects that benefit from regular customer feedback and iterative improvements.
Example: Developing a mobile app where user feedback is crucial, and features need to be adjusted based on user behavior and market trends.
